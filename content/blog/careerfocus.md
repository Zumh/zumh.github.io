## Why focus on "safety first" software engineering?
- We can plan and build all we want, if the product is not safe or secure then it is useless.
- Why this is matter?
    - It come with "planning backward and moving forward" thinking approach.
    - We paint the picture what we want
    - We identify obstacles as we questions what require to achieve each stage.
    - We build a system/mechanism that allow us to test each stage to verify we good to move next stage.
    - 
- With this approach we can test our product with AI, network attack and several other methods to test robustness of our product.
- Usability must be sutpidly simple and covenient.
