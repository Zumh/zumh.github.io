##### HackCanada (Wilfrid Laurier), GameJam x2 (Conestoga College) - (2025 Febuary 21 - 28)
######  Waterloo, Ontario, Canada
I participated in two hackathons, both with over 100+ participants and tight deadlines, emphasizing simplicity, time management, and collaboration. 
- At Hack Canada, we developed a full-stack web solution addressing food shortages.
- At Game Jam, we created games using Unity and C# and I managed teams of 3-5. 

These experiences enhanced my problem-solving, technical, and leadership skills, preparing me to excel in fast-paced, collaborative environments.
